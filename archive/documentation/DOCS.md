# Claude Code Zero-Trust Security Framework
## Complete Documentation and Specification

## Overview

The Claude Code Zero-Trust Security Framework is a comprehensive security system that implements client-side secret detection and replacement to prevent real secrets from being transmitted to Claude's API. It provides a complete zero-trust architecture as requested in Issue #2695.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **SecretDetector Interface**
   - Abstract base class for all secret detection mechanisms
   - Defines standard interface for secret detection and replacement
   - Supports multiple detection strategies (pattern, entropy, ML, etc.)

2. **PatternDetector**
   - Regex-based secret detection
   - Configurable patterns for different secret types
   - Built-in validation to reduce false positives

3. **ZeroTrustProcessor**
   - Main orchestration component
   - Coordinates detection and replacement workflows
   - Manages placeholder generation and mapping

4. **ClaudeCodeHook**
   - Integration layer with Claude Code's hook system
   - Processes tool calls and file operations
   - Maintains security context across operations

5. **VerificationEngine** (NEW)
   - Real verification of security claims
   - Integration with formal methods (Coq proofs)
   - Evidence-based assertion validation

### Secret Types Supported

1. **API Keys**
   - OpenAI API Keys (`sk-` followed by 48 characters)
   - Anthropic API Keys (`sk-ant-` followed by 94 characters and ending with `R`)
   - AWS Access Keys (`AKIA` followed by 16 uppercase letters/numbers)

2. **Authentication Tokens**
   - GitHub Personal Access Tokens
   - Google API Keys
   - Slack Tokens
   - JWT Tokens

3. **Connection Strings**
   - Database connection strings
   - Service endpoints with embedded credentials

### Zero-Trust Workflow

1. **Detection Phase**
   - Analyze content for potential secrets
   - Apply multiple detection strategies
   - Validate findings to reduce false positives

2. **Replacement Phase**
   - Generate unique placeholders for detected secrets
   - Replace secrets with placeholders in content
   - Maintain mapping for local resolution

3. **Transmission Phase**
   - Send sanitized content to Claude's API
   - Ensure real secrets never leave the local environment

4. **Local Execution Phase**
   - Resolve placeholders to real values for local operations
   - Maintain security context throughout execution

## Integration Points

### Claude Code Hooks
- **PreToolUse**: Inspect and sanitize tool calls before execution
- **PostToolUse**: Verify results and prevent secret leakage
- **FileRead**: Sanitize file content before transmission
- **ResponseValidation**: Validate Claude's responses for security claims

### MCP Server Integration
- Secure environment variable handling
- Credential injection for local tool execution
- Audit logging for all security-relevant operations

## Security Features

### Secret Detection
- Pattern-based detection with configurable rules
- Entropy analysis for random-looking strings
- Context-aware detection to reduce false positives
- Custom detection modules for specialized needs

### False Positive Reduction
- Test pattern filtering (example, test, dummy, etc.)
- Context analysis to distinguish real vs. documentation secrets
- Confidence scoring for detection results
- User override mechanisms for edge cases

### Audit and Compliance
- Comprehensive logging of all security operations
- Tamper-proof audit trails
- Compliance reporting for enterprise requirements
- Integration with SIEM and monitoring systems

## API Specification

### SecretDetector Interface
```python
class SecretDetector(ABC):
    def detect_secrets(self, content: str) -> List[SecretMatch]:
        """Detect secrets in content and return matches"""
        pass
    
    def get_secret_type(self) -> str:
        """Return the type of secrets this detector finds"""
        pass

class SecretMatch:
    def __init__(self, value: str, start: int, end: int, confidence: float):
        self.value = value
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
        self.confidence = confidence
```

### ZeroTrustProcessor Interface
```python
class ZeroTrustProcessor:
    def process_content(self, content: str) -> Tuple[str, Dict[str, str]]:
        """Process content and replace secrets with placeholders"""
        pass
    
    def restore_content(self, processed_content: str, mapping: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
        """Restore content by replacing placeholders with real values"""
        pass
```

### ClaudeCodeHook Interface
```python
class ClaudeCodeHook:
    def process_tool_call(self, tool_call: Dict) -> Tuple[Optional[Dict], Dict[str, str]]:
        """Process tool call and return sanitized version"""
        pass
    
    def validate_response(self, response: str) -> bool:
        """Validate response for security compliance"""
        pass
```
